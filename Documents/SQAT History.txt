SNP Quality Analysis Tool History
---------------------------------

v 2.0.2137.21508

* Created.


v 2.0.2138.16385

* Minor changes in the GUI.


v 2.0.2141.29058

* An error which calculated allele frequencies wrongly when any of
the number of homozygotes or the number of heterozygotes were zero
was corrected.


v 2.1.2172.17064

* The program uses a simplified and more tailor-suited database schema.

* The user is able to select database from a list of possible connections,
as entered in the "SQATconnect.xml" file.

* The names of the database and the user are displayed in the main window.

* When the program starts, it makes sure that the current user is
listed in the database.

* All control samples are left unrejected when rejecting samples in
a plate, no matter if the rejection is based on wells, genotyping
success rates for assays or genotyping success rates for samples.

* An approved session can be unlocked by the user.

* The program no longer crashes if there is no project in the database.

* It is possible to create lists of both subjects and samples to rerun.


-----------

v 3.0.2490.13058

* Redesigned database and quality control procedures for more efficient computations.
This includes making a selection for marker or assay and sample or individual when
starting a new session.

* It is possible to create a report directly from the database without showing the results
on screen.

* The genotyping success per well can be viewed when inspecting individual plates.

* All genotypes from selected samples or individuals can be more easily rejected.

* There are more alternatives regarding which information should be included in a saved report.

* It is possible to view which selections of plates and working sets have
been made from within an ongoing session.

* A dedicated menu for performing operations on all markers/assays has been added.

* Genotypes from selected samples/individuals and controls can be viewed more easily.

...and more


v 3.0.2517.26082

* Corrected error in previous version which gave no difference in the HW chi2 value with
or without children if the the inheritance test was turned off.

* Changed the text file format to include tabs for all fields, also when the rest of a row
is empty.

* The chromosome name is included in the experiment statistics list.

* Introduced a workaround to correct the bug with gridline repainting in the .NET ListView
control. Now gridlines are showed correctly.

* Corrected error in previous version which occurred when sample workingsets were selected.
 
* Corrected error in previous version which occurred when trying to reject items or wells with
low success rate in plates when using individual mode.

* A default value of "*/*" was set for empty results.


v 3.0.2545.21232

* Corrected two stability problems which previously could result in an error message ("There is
already an open data reader associated with this command which must be closed first") or the
calculations showing no results.


v 3.1.2614.15628

* The possibility to compare genotypes between open sessions, files and reference data sets
in the database has been added.

* A new preference setting has been added which makes it possible to filter the displayed
experiments in the Experiments list, so that the number of shown experiments can be limited
after sorting them on the database side.

* The way that control items and projects are represented in the database has been changed.

* Corrected an error in the result report which only showed the first item if there was only
one experiment in the open session or only the first experiment if there was only one item
in the open session and the experiments were listed in columns and rows respectively.

* Corrected an error which gave chromosome X warnings for male individuals with two different
samples with e.g. A/A and G/G, even though there were no heterozygotes.


v 3.1.2669.13199

* Project permissions are implemented.

* The program no longer crashes when a comparison between genotypes in different data sets
is aborted.

* The function for comparison of genotypes between different data sets is much faster. 

* The filter for the number of experiments to be displayed only fetches the displayed
experiments from the database, instead of all experiments.

* It is possible to set the genotype status to both load and rejected for selected experiments,
all experiments, selected items and selected control items.


v 3.1.2732.27181

* Faster implementation of the inheritance test for SQL Server 2005.


v 3.1.3050.17232

<Never released>


v 3.1.3055.16570

<Never released>


v 3.1.3055.17176

* An "about" box was added.

* Any dependency on nucleotides being only "A", "C", "G" or "T" has been removed
to allow also for insertion and deletion polymorphisms.

* The export of XML report files was changed to contain all information needed by
internal reports in the Chiasma program.


v 3.2.3090.13120

* A function was added for identifying samples or individuals by comparing the
genotype results over all markers/assays.

* It is possible to set the status for genotypes in specific wells also to "load" and
not only to "rejected".

* When you save or approve a session the program opens the project to which the plates
of the session belong in the "Save as" dialog.

* It is possible to see the trios or duos which failed in the inheritance test for
all or selected experiments.

* A new column was added in the item statistics list for success rate over nonfailed
experiments. It is also possible to select this column for cutoff.

v 3.2.3818.16498

* Option to upload internal report directly into the chiasma database instead of saving an
internal report file. Both ways to save an internal report (into database or to file) is 
available at the File menu. The button save internal report now refers to save to the database.
 
v 3.2.4535.18838

* Bugfix, a timeout property (SqlBulkCopy, bulkCopyTimeout) is set to prevent timeout exception when
  uploading large internal reports to the Chiasma database.

v 3.2.4860.19855
(Never released)

23/4 2013
v 3.2.4861.21063
* Reports based on samples (not individuals) can be imported into Chiasma. For 
  these reports, inheritance tests is only performed on inh-control samples. 
  Total number and number of failed ctl-inh-test for a marker is counted
  in the same way as if the report was based on individuals. 
* Bugfix: report based on samples can be exported into XML-format without any syntax errors.
* Default string for missing genotype is -/- instead of */* in identify items and compare results

29/10 2013
v 3.2.5050.23810
* The connection is against the new server, mm-wchs001

11/2 2015
v 3.2.5520.23433
* Bugfix, uploading internal reports to Chiasma database, class Sample load fields tube_id and plate_id instead of container_id
